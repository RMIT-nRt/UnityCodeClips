These are some simple scripts for the camera:

 1. **CameraFollow:** Place the script on the camera, ensure the Player has the "Player" tag and viola, <br>
    the camera will follow your player at a speed you can set.
 2. **CameraShake:** This is a simple script that will shake the camera, when desired, for a set length <br>
    of time or can be kept on for a required event length. This could be used when the player is <br>
    injured or to simulate movement of large objects.
