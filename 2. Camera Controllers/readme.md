**CAMERA CONTROLLERS:**

These are some simple scripts for the camera:

 1. **CameraFollow:** Place the script on the camera, ensure the Player has the "Player" tag and viola!
 2. **CameraShake:** This is a simple script that will shake the camera, when desired, for a
    set length of time or can be kept on for a required event length. This could be used when
    the player is injured or to simulate movement of large objects.
